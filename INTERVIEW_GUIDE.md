### **4. 📊 `monitoring/` - Observability Stack**
**Purpose:** Comprehensive monitoring and alerting solution
**Contents:**
```
monitoring/
├── dashboards/                 # Custom Grafana dashboards
│   ├── kubernetes-cluster-overview.json
│   ├── application-performance.json
│   ├── security-compliance.json
│   └── cost-optimization.json
├── prometheus/                 # Prometheus configuration
└── alerting/                   # Alert rules and policies
```

**Interview Questions & Answers:**
- **Q: "How do you implement monitoring in a multi-cloud environment?"**
- **A:** "I use Prometheus for metrics collection with custom dashboards for each cloud provider. The monitoring stack provides unified visibility across AWS EKS, GCP GKE, and Azure AKS clusters."

- **Q: "What metrics do you monitor?"**
- **A:** "I monitor four key areas: Infrastructure (CPU, memory, disk), Application (response times, error rates), Security (policy violations, access attempts), and Cost (resource utilization, spend optimization)."

### **5. 🛡️ `security/` - Security & Policy Management**
**Purpose:** Security controls and compliance automation
**Contents:**
```
security/

└── istio-config.yaml          # Service mesh security config
```

**Interview Questions & Answers:**
- **Q: "How do you enforce security policies in Kubernetes?"**
- **A:** "I use OPA Gatekeeper for policy-as-code. It prevents non-compliant resources from being created, enforcing security standards like resource limits, image policies, and label requirements."

- **Q: "What's your approach to service-to-service security?"**
- **A:** "I implement Istio service mesh for automatic mTLS, traffic policies, and zero-trust networking. This ensures all inter-service communication is encrypted and authenticated."

### **6. 🏗️ `terraform/` - Infrastructure as Code**
**Purpose:** Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning
**Contents:**
```
terraform/
├── main.tf                     # Root Terraform configuration
├── variables.tf                # Input variables
├── outputs.tf                  # Output values
├── environments/               # Environment-specific configs
│   ├── dev/
│   │   └── terraform.tfvars

```

**Interview Questions & Answers:**
- **Q: "How do you manage infrastructure across multiple environments?"**
- **A:** "I use Terraform modules for reusability and environment-specific tfvars files. This ensures consistent infrastructure while allowing environment-specific customizations."

- **Q: "What's your strategy for Terraform state management?"**
- **A:** "I use remote state backends (S3/Azure Blob) with state locking (DynamoDB/Azure Storage) to prevent conflicts. Each environment has separate state files for isolation."

**Response:**
"This is a multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure project that demonstrates enterprise DevOps practices. The architecture spans AWS EKS, GCP GKE, and Azure AKS clusters, all managed through Terraform Infrastructure as Code.

The monitoring stack uses Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization, with custom dashboards for different stakeholders. Security is implemented through OPA Gatekeeper policies and Istio service mesh.

I've created multiple deployment options to accommodate different environments - from local development with Docker/Minikube to cloud playgrounds and production deployments."
