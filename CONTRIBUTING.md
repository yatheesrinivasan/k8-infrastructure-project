# Kubernetes Infrastructure Project - Development Notes

**Personal Project by Yathee Srinivasan**

This document outlines my development approach, technical standards, and testing methodologies used in building this enterprise Kubernetes infrastructure.

## ÔøΩÔ∏è My Development Environment

### Technology Stack Selected
- **AWS Account**: Personal AWS account for hands-on cloud experience
- **Terraform >= 1.0**: Infrastructure as Code for repeatable deployments  
- **kubectl >= 1.24**: Kubernetes cluster management and debugging
- **AWS CLI >= 2.0**: Programmatic AWS resource management
- **Helm >= 3.8**: Kubernetes package management for complex applications

### My Development Workflow  
1. **Research Phase**: Studied enterprise Kubernetes patterns and AWS best practices
2. **Incremental Development**: Built each module independently and tested integration points
3. **Security Integration**: Implemented security controls throughout development, not as an afterthought
4. **Documentation-Driven**: Maintained comprehensive documentation for future reference and knowledge sharing
5. **Testing & Validation**: Verified each component works in isolation and as part of the complete system

## üß™ Testing

### Infrastructure Testing
- Always run `terraform plan` before applying changes
- Test in development environment first
- Validate security configurations

### Security Testing
```bash
# Run security scans
./scripts/security-scan.sh scan-common
./scripts/security-scan.sh scan-k8s kubernetes/
```

### Monitoring Testing
- Verify dashboards load correctly
- Test alert rules
- Validate metrics collection

## üìù My Technical Standards & Practices

### Terraform Code Quality
- **HashiCorp Style Guide**: Followed official Terraform conventions for consistency
- **Meaningful Naming**: Used descriptive resource names that clearly indicate purpose and scope
- **Comprehensive Tagging**: Implemented consistent tagging strategy for cost tracking and resource management
- **Documentation**: Ensured all variables and outputs include descriptions and usage examples

### Kubernetes Best Practices  
- **API Version Strategy**: Used stable API versions to ensure long-term compatibility
- **Security by Design**: Implemented security contexts, network policies, and RBAC from the start
- **Resource Management**: Defined CPU/memory limits and requests for all workloads
- **Metadata Standards**: Applied consistent labeling and annotation strategy for operational visibility

### Documentation Philosophy
- **README-Driven Development**: Wrote comprehensive documentation before and during implementation
- **Decision Recording**: Documented architectural decisions and their rationale
- **Troubleshooting Focus**: Included common issues and resolution steps based on testing experience
- **Interview Readiness**: Structured documentation to facilitate technical discussions

## üîí Security Guidelines

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Run vulnerability scans on container images
- Follow least privilege principles
- Review security policies before changes

## üêõ Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports
- Include environment details
- Provide reproduction steps
- Add relevant logs or error messages

## üìã Pull Request Process

1. Ensure CI checks pass
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Add tests for new features
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Address feedback promptly

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help others learn and grow
- Maintain professional communication
