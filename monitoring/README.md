## 🔧 Dashboard Integration

### How Dashboards are Loaded

The dashboards are automatically integrated into your Grafana instance through several mechanisms:

#### 1. **Terraform Integration**
```hcl
# In terraform/modules/monitoring/enhanced_monitoring.tf
dashboards = {
  custom = {
    "multicloud-cluster-overview" = file("${path.module}/../../monitoring/dashboards/kubernetes-cluster-overview.json")
    "application-performance" = file("${path.module}/../../monitoring/dashboards/application-performance.json")
    "security-compliance" = file("${path.module}/../../monitoring/dashboards/security-compliance.json")
    "cost-optimization" = file("${path.module}/../../monitoring/dashboards/cost-optimization.json")
  }
}
```

#### 2. **ConfigMap Deployment** 
```yaml
# monitoring/grafana-dashboards-configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: grafana-dashboards-multicloud
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    grafana_dashboard: "1"  # Auto-discovery label
```

#### 3. **Dashboard Providers Configuration**
```yaml
# Automatic dashboard loading configuration
providers:
  - name: 'multi-cloud-dashboards'
    orgId: 1
    folder: 'Multi-Cloud'
    type: file
    updateIntervalSeconds: 10
    allowUiUpdates: true
```

### Deployment Process

1. **Terraform Deployment**: Dashboards are embedded in Helm chart values
2. **ConfigMap Creation**: Additional dashboards loaded via ConfigMaps
3. **Auto-Discovery**: Grafana automatically detects and loads dashboards
4. **Provider Setup**: Dashboard providers manage folders and permissions

## 📈 Metrics and Data Sources

### Primary Data Sources

1. **Prometheus**: Core metrics collection
   - Kubernetes cluster metrics
   - Node and pod performance data
   - Custom application metrics

2. **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing
   - Service-to-service communication
   - Request flow analysis
   - Performance bottleneck identification

3. **Loki**: Log aggregation
   - Centralized log collection
   - Log-based alerting
   - Correlation with metrics and traces

4. **Cloud Provider APIs**: Cost and billing data
   - AWS Cost Explorer integration
   - GCP Billing API metrics
   - Azure Cost Management data

### Custom Labels for Multi-Cloud

All metrics are enhanced with cloud provider labels:

```promql
# Example metrics with cloud provider context
up{job="kubernetes-nodes",cloud_provider="aws",cluster="prod-us-west"}
up{job="kubernetes-nodes",cloud_provider="gcp",cluster="prod-us-central"}  
up{job="kubernetes-nodes",cloud_provider="azure",cluster="prod-eastus"}
```

## 🚀 Accessing Dashboards

### Local Development
```bash
# Port forward Grafana service
./scripts/deploy-multicloud.sh port-forward grafana dev

# Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000
# Default credentials: admin / admin123
```

### Production Access
```bash
# Get Grafana URL from Terraform outputs
terraform output grafana_url

# Or use kubectl port-forward for secure access
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80
```

## 🎯 Dashboard Variables and Filters

Each dashboard includes dynamic variables for filtering:

- **Cluster**: Filter by specific Kubernetes cluster
- **Cloud Provider**: Focus on AWS, GCP, or Azure
- **Namespace**: Scope to specific application namespaces
- **Service**: Application service filtering
- **Time Range**: Flexible time period selection

## 🔔 Alerting Integration

Dashboards are integrated with Prometheus alerting:

```yaml
# Example alert integration in dashboards
annotations:
  list:
    - name: "Security Alerts"
      expr: 'ALERTS{alertname=~".*Security.*|.*Policy.*"}'
      iconColor: "red"
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Dashboards

1. **Create JSON file** in `dashboards/` directory
2. **Update Terraform configuration** in `enhanced_monitoring.tf`
3. **Deploy changes** using deployment scripts
4. **Verify** dashboard appears in Grafana

### Modifying Existing Dashboards

1. **Edit JSON files** directly or use Grafana UI
2. **Export updated JSON** from Grafana if modified in UI
3. **Commit changes** to version control
4. **Redeploy** to apply updates
