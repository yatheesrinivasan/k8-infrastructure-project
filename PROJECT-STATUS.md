- Zero-trust network policies with explicit allow-lists
- RBAC design following enterprise security patterns
- Encrypted secrets management with KMS integration
- Pod security standards enforcement

✅ **DevOps Automation (My Scripts)**
- Cross-platform deployment scripts (Bash + PowerShell)
- Automated security scanning pipeline integration
- Complete infrastructure lifecycle management
- Monitoring service access and log aggregation tools

✅ **Professional Documentation (My Writing)**
- Enterprise-grade README with comprehensive setup guides
- Detailed architecture decisions and technical rationale
- Troubleshooting guides based on operational experience
- Contribution guidelines for team collaboration

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Create Private GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd C:\temp\k8s-infrastructure-project
   
   # Create new repository on GitHub (private)
   # Then push your code:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/k8s-infrastructure-project.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Test Deployment**
   - Start with development environment
   - Verify all components deploy successfully
   - Access monitoring dashboards

3. **Customize Configuration**
   - Update cluster names in terraform.tfvars
   - Adjust resource limits based on needs
   - Configure alerting endpoints

## 💡 My Technical Decision-Making Process

**Terraform Modular Architecture**: I chose to separate concerns into discrete modules (VPC, EKS, Security, Monitoring) to enable reusability across environments and simplify maintenance. This mirrors enterprise patterns I've studied and implemented.

**AWS EKS Selection**: Selected managed Kubernetes to focus on application and security concerns rather than cluster management overhead, allowing me to demonstrate higher-level architectural thinking.

**Prometheus/Grafana Stack**: Implemented the industry-standard monitoring solution with custom configurations, demonstrating my understanding of observability best practices and ability to integrate enterprise tools.

**Custom DaemonSet Strategy**: Developed a purpose-built logging solution to ensure comprehensive node coverage and demonstrate my ability to create custom Kubernetes resources for specific operational requirements.

**Defense-in-Depth Security**: Implemented multiple security layers (network, container, application) showing my understanding that security cannot be an afterthought in modern infrastructure.

**Cross-Platform Automation**: Created both Bash and PowerShell implementations, demonstrating consideration for diverse development environments and operational requirements.

## 🎯 Project Value Proposition

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- **Architect enterprise-grade infrastructure** from first principles
- **Implement security best practices** throughout the development lifecycle  
- **Create comprehensive monitoring** for operational excellence
- **Automate complex deployments** with robust scripting
- **Document professional-grade solutions** for team collaboration
